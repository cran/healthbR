# healthbR 0.2.0

## New modules

* **CNES (National Health Facility Registry)**: Health facility data from
  DATASUS FTP as .dbc files (2005-2024). 13 file types (ST, LT, PF, DC, EQ,
  SR, HB, EP, RC, IN, EE, EF, GM), monthly data per UF.

* **SINAN (Notifiable Diseases Surveillance)**: Disease notification microdata
  from DATASUS FTP as .dbc files (2007-2024). 31 diseases including DENG, CHIK,
  ZIKA, TUBE, HANS, HEPA, MALA, and more.

* **SI-PNI (National Immunization Program)**: Aggregated vaccination data from
  DATASUS FTP as .DBF files (1994-2019), plus individual-level microdata from
  OpenDataSUS CSV (2020-2025). Transparent year-based routing between sources.

* **SISAB (Primary Care Health Information)**: Coverage indicators from the
  relatorioaps REST API. 4 report types (aps, sb, acs, pns) at 4 geographic
  levels (brazil, region, uf, municipality).

* **ANS (Supplementary Health)**: Beneficiary, complaint, and financial data
  from the ANS open data portal. Plus `ans_operators()` for operator registry.

* **ANVISA (Health Surveillance)**: Product registrations, pharmacovigilance,
  hemovigilance, technovigilance, and controlled substance sales (SNGPC)
  from the ANVISA open data portal. 14 data types total.

* **POF (Household Budget Survey)**: Food security, consumption, and health
  expenditure microdata from IBGE FTP (2002-2003, 2008-2009, 2017-2018).

* **PNADC (PNAD Continua)**: Health-related supplementary modules from PNAD
  Continua (deficiencia, habitacao, moradores, APS).

* **PNS (National Health Survey)**: Microdata and SIDRA tabulated data
  (2013, 2019).

* **Censo Demografico**: Population denominators from the IBGE SIDRA API,
  covering Census years 1970-2022 and intercensitary estimates 2001-2021.

## Performance improvements

* Hive-style partitioned parquet caching for all DATASUS modules.

* Lazy evaluation with `lazy = TRUE` and `backend = "arrow"` or `"duckdb"`
  for out-of-memory queries.

* Parallel downloads via `.map_parallel()` (furrr when configured, purrr
  fallback).

* Concurrent HTTP downloads for SI-PNI multi-month CSV requests via
  `curl::multi_download()`.

* Resumable HTTP downloads via Range headers for large files.

* Smart type parsing (`parse = TRUE`) for all 7 DATASUS modules, with
  automatic numeric and date column conversion. Use `col_types` for
  fine-grained control or `parse = FALSE` for all-character.

## Refactoring

* Extracted shared helpers for validation, search, cache management, and
  return logic, eliminating ~1100 lines of duplication across modules.

* Removed deprecated flat cache migration infrastructure.

* Moved `readxl` and `haven` from Imports to Suggests.

* Removed unused `vroom` from Suggests.

## Breaking changes

* Complete refactoring of VIGITEL functions due to Ministry of Health website
  restructuring. Data is now distributed as a single consolidated file
  containing all years (2006-2024) instead of separate files per year.

* `vigitel_data()` API changed: new `format` parameter, `year` defaults to

  NULL (all years), removed `lazy`/`parallel`/`force_download` parameters.

* Removed `vigitel_download()` and `vigitel_convert_to_parquet()` functions.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed PNS Arrow expression error with partition filtering.
* Fixed `pns_sidra_data()` unknown table warning.
* Fixed POF dictionary parsing failure on Linux/Ubuntu.

# healthbR 0.1.1

## Changes

* Moved `arrow` package from `Imports` to `Suggests` for better cross-platform
  compatibility. The package now checks for `arrow` availability and provides
  informative error messages with installation instructions when needed.

* Added `cache_dir` parameter to all data fetching functions (`vigitel_data()`,
  `vigitel_download()`, `vigitel_variables()`, `vigitel_dictionary()`,
  `vigitel_cache_status()`, `vigitel_clear_cache()`). This allows using
  `tempdir()` for temporary storage that doesn't persist after the R session.

* Updated examples to use `cache_dir = tempdir()` to avoid leaving files on the
  system during CRAN checks.

## healthbR 0.0.0.9000

### New features

* `vigitel_years()` - list available VIGITEL survey years
* `vigitel_variables()` - list variables available in a specific year
* `vigitel_dictionary()` - get the data dictionary with variable descriptions
* `vigitel_data()` - download and load VIGITEL data with multiple options:
  - Support for single or multiple years
  - Automatic caching to avoid repeated downloads
  - Parquet conversion for faster subsequent loads
  - Parallel downloads with `furrr`
  - Lazy evaluation with Arrow for memory-efficient processing
* `vigitel_convert_to_parquet()` - convert cached Excel files to Parquet format

### Performance

* Parquet format support for 10-20x faster data loading
* Parallel download support via `furrr` package
* Lazy evaluation via Arrow for processing large datasets without loading into RAM
