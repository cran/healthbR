# healthbR 0.4.0

*First CRAN release since 0.2.0: this version also carries everything in
0.3.0 and 0.3.1 below (SI-PNI on the healthbr-data mirror, SI-PNI
dictionary corrections), which were GitHub-only.*

## New vignette: healthbR vs microdatasus

* `vignette("healthbr-vs-microdatasus")` compares healthbR with
  [microdatasus](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=microdatasus) on the
  DATASUS systems both read (SIM, SINASC, SIH, SIA, SINAN, CNES): coverage
  table, what each package does with the raw codes (labels vs. codes plus
  dictionary), where the bytes come from (DATASUS FTP `.dbc` vs. the
  healthbr-data Parquet mirror with provenance), lazy evaluation, cache, and
  a measured run of the same three downloads (SIH RR 2023-01, SIM and SINASC
  AC 2022) in both packages. README and DESCRIPTION now name DATASUS and the
  neighbouring packages (microdatasus, PySUS, basedosdados) so the
  comparison is findable.

## SIH: R2 backend

* **Warm calls no longer pay for the manifest summary.** Turning the
  mirror's manifest (11,157 partitions on 2026-09-05) into the
  `sih_status()` tibble cost ~4.6 s and ran on *every* `sih_data(source =
  "r2")` call, so a one-file read from a warm cache took ~5.5 s against
  0.9 s from the FTP. The per-partition output-file lookup is now done once
  and the summary is memoised per manifest content (`rlang::hash()`), the
  way the parsed manifest already was: the same warm read now takes ~0.8 s
  and `sih_status()` ~0.75 s. Found while measuring the comparison vignette.

The [healthbr-data](https://github.com/SidneyBissoli/healthbr-data) mirror
(hive-partitioned Parquet on Cloudflare R2, one partition per DATASUS file
`RD{UF}{yy}{mm}.dbc`, values byte-identical, 1992-present, provenance record
per file) is now the default source of the SIH module, the same design the
SI-PNI module adopted in 0.3.0:

* **`source` argument** in `sih_data()`: `c("r2", "datasus")` (default)
  reads from the mirror and falls back to the DATASUS FTP when the mirror
  yields nothing; a single value pins a source. `r2_credentials` points at
  another bucket. Without \pkg{arrow} the FTP is used directly. Both
  transports share the local partitioned cache.
* **`sih_status()`** (new): one row per published partition (competence x
  UF) from the mirror's manifest, with the DATASUS URL, MD5 and size of the
  source file, record count and processing timestamp -- the way to see
  which competences exist and whether a file was re-issued. It also carries
  the Parquet behind each partition (`parquet_path`, `parquet_sha256`,
  `parquet_size_bytes`) and the healthbr-data pipeline that wrote it
  (`pipeline_version`, `git_commit`), with the manifest's `last_updated`
  and `manifest_version` as attributes -- enough for a derived product to
  record exactly which files it was built from (the sih-br-mcp cubes do).
* **Provenance attributes**: `attr(x, "healthbr_source")` says which source
  served the tibble; from the mirror, `attr(x, "healthbr_provenance")` lists
  the source files behind it.
* **Lazy over the mirror**: `sih_data(lazy = TRUE)` now returns a remote
  arrow (or duckdb) dataset over R2 -- nothing is transferred until
  `collect()`, and filters and column selections are pushed down. The
  mirror's 14 historical schemas are handled by imposing the schema of the
  newest requested year, so only the requested years are ever read.
* Documentation now states that `year`/`month` are the AIH's **billing
  competence**, not the admission date (`DT_INTER`), and that the four
  competences after a year close 99.7-99.9% of its admissions (measured on
  the whole mirror).

## Cache

* **`*_clear_cache()` now clears the partitioned cache too.** The shared
  `.clear_cache()` removed only flat `<module>_*.parquet|rds` files and left
  the hive-partitioned dataset directories (`sih_data/`, `sim_data/`,
  `sipni_r2_data/`, ...) behind, so `sih_clear_cache()` answered "No cached
  SIH files to clear" while `sih_cache_status()` still listed the partitions
  -- and a "cold" download timed right after clearing was served from the
  cache. It now removes the same directories `.cache_status()` reports and
  says how many partition files went. Affects every module with a
  partitioned cache. Found while measuring the comparison vignette.

## DATASUS year coverage (fixes a broken download)

* **SINAN**: 2023, 2024 and 2025 were promoted by DATASUS from `PRELIM/` to
  `FINAIS/`; the package still built `PRELIM/` URLs for 2023-2024, which no
  longer exist on the FTP, so `sinan_data(2023)`/`sinan_data(2024)` failed.
  Year lists updated: final = 2007-2025, preliminary = 2026.
* **SIH**, **SIA**, **CNES**: 2025 and 2026 (files published through
  2026-05/06/07) are now accepted as preliminary years; 2024 is now final.

Detected by the portfolio source monitor (edition probing against the
DATASUS FTP); the year lists in `R/*_data_internal.R` remain the source of
truth until discovery is made dynamic.

# healthbR 0.3.1

## SI-PNI dictionary corrections (important)

* **The built-in SI-PNI dictionary and label maps were wrong** and have been
  regenerated from the Ministry's official .cnv/.dbf dictionary files (as
  published on the healthbr-data mirror). The 0.2.0 hand-written table
  mislabeled 19 of 20 IMUNO codes — e.g. data code `09` is *Haemophilus
  influenzae tipo b (Hib)* per the official .cnv, not *BCG* (BCG is data
  code `02`) — and used DOSE/FX_ETARIA codes that do not occur in the data
  at all. Any decoding done with the built-in dictionary of previous
  versions should be redone. Regeneration script: `data-raw/sipni-dictionaries.R`.
* **New `lookup = TRUE` in `sipni_dictionary()`**: returns a data-code
  lookup (one row per value as it appears in the data, expanding the .cnv
  `source_codes` — including comma lists like `88,45` and ranges like
  `11-31`), ready to join against `sipni_data()` results. Joining data
  against the .cnv `code` column decodes to wrong labels; the vignette
  examples were corrected accordingly. Overlapping categories are resolved
  by specificity — explicitly listed codes beat range catch-alls — so
  residuals like FX_ETARIA "Idade ignorada" (source codes `00-99`) only
  label codes no specific category claimed.

## Fixes and polish

* **Local partitioned caches are now opened with `unify_schemas = TRUE`**
  (all modules): when cached years carry different column sets — DPNI 1994
  has 7 columns, 2019 has 12 — reads used the first file's schema and
  silently dropped the extra columns of other years.
* Results served from the local cache now place the identifier columns
  (`year`, `month`, `uf_source`) first, matching fresh downloads.
* `sipni_cache_status()` (and every module's `*_cache_status()`) now also
  reports hive-partitioned cache datasets, which were previously invisible.
* Roxygen comments no longer leak `\u` escapes into Rd files
  (R CMD check WARNING).
* Test hygiene: tests hitting httpbin.org now skip when the service is
  unreachable; `pnadc_apply_survey_design()` error tests skip without
  `srvyr`.

# healthbR 0.3.0

## SI-PNI: R2 backend (fixes #1)

The old OpenDataSUS host (`arquivosdadosabertos.saude.gov.br`) was
decommissioned and, as of 2026, the Ministry removed the 2020-2025 microdata
files from the new location as well — `sipni_data()` for years >= 2020 had
been failing with 404 (#1). This release makes the
[healthbr-data](https://github.com/SidneyBissoli/healthbr-data) mirror
(hive-partitioned Parquet on Cloudflare R2, values byte-identical to the
Ministry's files, complete 2020+ series) the default source for the whole
SI-PNI module:

* **`source` argument** in `sipni_data()` and `sipni_dictionary()`:
  `c("r2", "datasus")` (default) reads from the R2 mirror and falls back to
  the official DATASUS/OpenDataSUS sources automatically; pass a single
  value to pin a source. `r2_credentials` allows pointing at another
  S3-compatible bucket.
* **`sipni_status()`** (new): month/UF-level availability and provenance of
  the mirror, read from its `manifest.json` files (processing timestamp,
  Ministry source URL, record counts). Manifests are cached locally and
  revalidated by ETag.
* **Provenance attributes**: results carry `healthbr_source` (which source
  served each era) and, for R2 reads, `healthbr_provenance` (per-partition
  processing timestamp + source URL).
* **Column names for 2020+ differ by source**: the mirror publishes the
  Ministry's JSON exports (56 fields: `dt_vacina`, `ds_vacina`, ...), while
  the OpenDataSUS CSVs use different names (`data_vacina`,
  `descricao_vacina`, ...). Each source returns its columns exactly as
  published — no renaming. See `sipni_variables(type = "API", source =)`.
* **`lazy = TRUE` with R2** returns the remote arrow dataset itself: dplyr
  verbs are pushed down and only the touched partitions are transferred
  (partition columns keep the bucket layout: `ano`, `mes`, `uf`).
* **Aggregates (1994-2019) and dictionaries** are also served from the
  mirror by default (much faster than DATASUS FTP, which remains available
  via `source = "datasus"`); the R2 dictionaries are the full versions
  converted from the Ministry's original .cnv/.dbf files, with a
  `source_codes` traceability column.
* The DATASUS CSV URL was updated to the new CKAN S3 address (only the
  current year is published there).
* The R2 backend requires the `arrow` package (in Suggests); without it,
  `sipni_data()` falls back to DATASUS with a message.

# healthbR 0.2.0

## New modules

* **CNES (National Health Facility Registry)**: Health facility data from
  DATASUS FTP as .dbc files (2005-2024). 13 file types (ST, LT, PF, DC, EQ,
  SR, HB, EP, RC, IN, EE, EF, GM), monthly data per UF.

* **SINAN (Notifiable Diseases Surveillance)**: Disease notification microdata
  from DATASUS FTP as .dbc files (2007-2024). 31 diseases including DENG, CHIK,
  ZIKA, TUBE, HANS, HEPA, MALA, and more.

* **SI-PNI (National Immunization Program)**: Aggregated vaccination data from
  DATASUS FTP as .DBF files (1994-2019), plus individual-level microdata from
  OpenDataSUS CSV (2020-2025). Transparent year-based routing between sources.

* **SISAB (Primary Care Health Information)**: Coverage indicators from the
  relatorioaps REST API. 4 report types (aps, sb, acs, pns) at 4 geographic
  levels (brazil, region, uf, municipality).

* **ANS (Supplementary Health)**: Beneficiary, complaint, and financial data
  from the ANS open data portal. Plus `ans_operators()` for operator registry.

* **ANVISA (Health Surveillance)**: Product registrations, pharmacovigilance,
  hemovigilance, technovigilance, and controlled substance sales (SNGPC)
  from the ANVISA open data portal. 14 data types total.

* **POF (Household Budget Survey)**: Food security, consumption, and health
  expenditure microdata from IBGE FTP (2002-2003, 2008-2009, 2017-2018).

* **PNADC (PNAD Continua)**: Health-related supplementary modules from PNAD
  Continua (deficiencia, habitacao, moradores, APS).

* **PNS (National Health Survey)**: Microdata and SIDRA tabulated data
  (2013, 2019).

* **Censo Demografico**: Population denominators from the IBGE SIDRA API,
  covering Census years 1970-2022 and intercensitary estimates 2001-2021.

## Performance improvements

* Hive-style partitioned parquet caching for all DATASUS modules.

* Lazy evaluation with `lazy = TRUE` and `backend = "arrow"` or `"duckdb"`
  for out-of-memory queries.

* Parallel downloads via `.map_parallel()` (furrr when configured, purrr
  fallback).

* Download progress bars for all modules using `cli::cli_progress_bar()`.
  Shows spinner, current/total count, progress bar, and estimated time
  remaining (ETA) during multi-file downloads.

* Concurrent HTTP downloads for SI-PNI multi-month CSV requests via
  `curl::multi_download()`.

* Resumable HTTP downloads via Range headers for large files.

* Smart type parsing (`parse = TRUE`) for all 7 DATASUS modules, with
  automatic numeric and date column conversion. Use `col_types` for
  fine-grained control or `parse = FALSE` for all-character.

## Refactoring

* Extracted shared helpers for validation, search, cache management, and
  return logic, eliminating ~1100 lines of duplication across modules.

* Reduced cyclomatic complexity across 11 high-complexity functions by
  extracting internal subfunctions. All exported and internal functions now
  have cyclomatic complexity below 15.

* Removed deprecated flat cache migration infrastructure.

* Moved `readxl` and `haven` from Imports to Suggests.

* Removed unused `vroom` from Suggests.

## Documentation

* Added "Parallel downloads" section to all 12 `*_data()` help pages
  (`?sim_data`, `?sih_data`, etc.) explaining how to enable parallel
  processing via `future::plan()`.

* Added "Parallel downloads" section to README with a working example.

## Governance

* Added `CONTRIBUTING.md` with contributor guidelines.

* Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant v2.1).

## Breaking changes

* Complete refactoring of VIGITEL functions due to Ministry of Health website
  restructuring. Data is now distributed as a single consolidated file
  containing all years (2006-2024) instead of separate files per year.

* `vigitel_data()` API changed: new `format` parameter, `year` defaults to

  NULL (all years), removed `lazy`/`parallel`/`force_download` parameters.

* Removed `vigitel_download()` and `vigitel_convert_to_parquet()` functions.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed PNS Arrow expression error with partition filtering.
* Fixed `pns_sidra_data()` unknown table warning.
* Fixed POF dictionary parsing failure on Linux/Ubuntu.
* Fixed SI-PNI download crash when DATASUS FTP file is missing or corrupted
  (added defensive `file.exists()` guard before `file.size()` check).

# healthbR 0.1.1

## Changes

* Moved `arrow` package from `Imports` to `Suggests` for better cross-platform
  compatibility. The package now checks for `arrow` availability and provides
  informative error messages with installation instructions when needed.

* Added `cache_dir` parameter to all data fetching functions (`vigitel_data()`,
  `vigitel_download()`, `vigitel_variables()`, `vigitel_dictionary()`,
  `vigitel_cache_status()`, `vigitel_clear_cache()`). This allows using
  `tempdir()` for temporary storage that doesn't persist after the R session.

* Updated examples to use `cache_dir = tempdir()` to avoid leaving files on the
  system during CRAN checks.
